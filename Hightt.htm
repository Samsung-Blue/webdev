<p class="writing" >Detect Technologies' (DeTect) provides high temperature guided wave ultrasonic (GWU) pipeline inspection system. The system is composed of a high temperature sensor which sends and receives an ultrasonic signal, software, and electronics. The key innovation is the high temperature magnetostrictive sensor (MsS) which allows the system to operate up to 350°C (660°F), in line fluid temperature. These systems are used to detect defects and corrosion in pipelines. Chemical plants, nuclear power plants and other industrial customers who process or transport high temperature fluids (>125°C or 260°F) through insulated pipes are be the target customers of the technology.</p>
<p class="writing" >Detect's high temperature sensor is currently being installed at Reliance Industries Ltd., Jamnagar. The sensor sends the data to cloud from an on board processing system, and this data can then be accessed through a graphic user interface from any location in the world. It is a state of art system for knowing the condition of a pipeline in real time.</p>
